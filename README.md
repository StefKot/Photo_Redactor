# Photo editor implementation
As part of this work, it is necessary to implement a program that allows you to open, save and process images in bmp24 format using the following operations:
1. Grayscale image conversion
2. Sobel operator (image gradient)
3. Laplace operator (the second derivative of the image)
4. Gaussian Blur
5. Border selection (optional, using the Canny operator)
6. Processing by an arbitrarily specified core
7. Optional median filter
8. Optional graphical interface

For the console version of the application, provide command-line arguments for entering the name of the input and output file, as well as the operations used.
